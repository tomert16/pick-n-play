- In the root directory in your terminal run `cp -p ./sample.env ./.env`
##### Once the .env file has been created
- run `docker compose build` in the terminal to build Docker images
- Once completed run `docker compose up` to start up the application
- Once all containers are up and running, open up a new tab in your terminal and run `docker compose run server rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`, to insert all of the necessary tables and seeds in the database.

- Client: In your terminal run `cp -p ./client/sample.env ./client/.env`
##### Once the .env file has been created
- Frontend: navigate to the frontend directory with `cd client`
- Open another tab in the terminal
- Backend: navigate to the backend directory with `cd server`
- Install all dependencies with `npm install` on the Frontend and `bundle install` on the Backend.
